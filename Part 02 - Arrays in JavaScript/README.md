# Arrays in JavaScript

## Intro to Arrays
Arrays are a fundamental data structure in JavaScript, allowing you to store multiple values in a single variable.

## Push, Pop, Shift, Unshift
- `push`: Adds elements to the end of an array.
- `pop`: Removes the last element from an array.
- `shift`: Removes the first element from an array.
- `unshift`: Adds elements to the beginning of an array.

## Primitive vs Reference Data Types
JavaScript arrays can contain both primitive and reference data types.

## Clone Array & Spread Operator
The spread operator (`...`) can be used to clone arrays efficiently.

## For Loop
Traditional `for` loops can be used to iterate over arrays.

## Using `const` for Creating Arrays
Arrays can be created using the `const` keyword for immutable arrays.

## While Loop in Array
While loops can also be used to iterate over arrays.

## For...of Loop
The `for...of` loop provides a simpler syntax for iterating over arrays.

## For...in Loop
The `for...in` loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an array.

## Array Destructuring
Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays into distinct variables.
